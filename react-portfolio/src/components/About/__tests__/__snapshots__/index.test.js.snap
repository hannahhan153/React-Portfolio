        My name is Hannah Han. I had the opportunity to be in the Columbia University's Boot Camp for Full Stack Web Development from 2021 to 2022. I learned many skills and languages. Through this program, I learned I am mostly interested in back-end development, and I am self-motivated and optimistic about finding a solution to a bug or issue I find. The portfolio section of this application will show the specific languages I used throughout this program and the skills I applied to optimize functionality.
